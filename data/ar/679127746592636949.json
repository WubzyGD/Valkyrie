{"does valk ever work?":"nope, not at all!","how does xp work?":"Basically without prestige, you gain 10XP per message, capped at one xp-gain per minute. So, if you're super active, you can technically gain 10xp per message per minute. GP is 15 per message. You also get a 50% boost for activity in this server specifically. Prestige and Lost Remnants, as well as special events will increase the amount of XP and GP gained from all sources via a fancy formula. You can prestige the first time at level 50."}
