# Privacy

In case you're at all worried about the information that Valkyrie stores and uses, and why, I'll explain it as clearly as possible here!

If you have any questions at all, feel free to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/T2JZtuf) and ask them!

> If you have questions about the accounts feature, there is information on it [here](https://wubzygd.github.io/Valkyrie/privacy#accounts)

## What we Store

Valkyrie does not store any identity-compromising information without you knowing (she actually never asks for this information at all, but you could still end up giving it to her)

We store your **Discord account ID** in order to associate it with your stats - like leveling and dice-counts. This is the only thing that will be stored without you explicitly providing that information or initiating a command to provide it.

If you edit server settings, we'll store those settings and your guild's ID, but nothing else. The same goes for auto-responses.

Essentially, **we don't store things that you don't give us**

## Why we Store it

This information is essential to the service that Valkyrie provides.

Your account ID is something that can never change, which is why we store *it* as opposed to storing your username and/or discriminator. However, this ID does not affect your account and can't be used for anything malicious. In fact, anyone can access a user's ID by just right-clicking a user with Developer Mode on in the settings.

Without it, we couldn't do XP, leveling, server settings, and all kinds of other sweet features that you know and love.

## Who can see my information?

People in servers you share can view things like your bio and stats, but most things are explicitly given by you.

If you don't want anyone to see something, just don't share it with Valkyrie in a command!

## Accounts

The accounts feature of Valkyrie is an experimental idea that is still a work-in-progress. However, it is **extremely important** to note that there are *no* passwords or credit cards or any of that stuff involved.

You simply provide a username of your choice and select a Faction to join, and that's all that happens! Your account will then be associated with your User ID, and your username and chosen Faction will be stored.

## Additional Information

By using Valkyrie, you agree that your user ID will be stored permanently in Valkyrie's database, and that any information you provide in a command intended for saving info for later use will be stored and might not be deletable.
