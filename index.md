## Set-up and FAQs

Before I get to the detailed stuff, here's some easy info on how to use the bot and get it working. 

### Adding

To add Valkyrie, make sure you have a Discord server set up, and you have Administrator priviledges for that server.

Then, simply follow [this handy link]() and select your server, and she's there - easy as that!

> As long as you don't uncheck any boxes and you have the right permissions in your server, Valkyrie should have all the permissions she needs to function. If you're experiencing issues or twitchy commands that you don't in other servers, this is likely the culprit.
